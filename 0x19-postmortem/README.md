Postmortem: The Great Load Balancer Fiasco of June 12, 2024
Issue Summary:

Duration: 2 hours and 15 minutes, from 14:00 UTC to 16:15 UTC
Impact: Our primary web service crashed, leaving 85% of our users staring at 500 Internal Server Errors and likely questioning their life choices (and ours).
Root Cause: A load balancer with a severe case of tunnel vision, directing all traffic to one poor, overworked server.
Timeline:

14:00 UTC: Issue detected. Monitoring alert screamed, “EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE!”
14:05 UTC: Engineers raced to the scene, logs and performance metrics in hand.
14:15 UTC: Assumed the database was the villain. Database team said, “Not it!”
14:30 UTC: Realized we were on a wild goose chase. Focus shifted to the app servers.
14:45 UTC: Network team noticed a tsunami of traffic swamping a single server.
15:00 UTC: Called in the DevOps squad. “Houston, we have a load balancer problem.”
15:30 UTC: Found the rogue rule in the load balancer configuration. Aha!
16:00 UTC: Fixed the rule, balanced the load, patted ourselves on the back.
16:15 UTC: Service restored. Monitoring confirmed, “All systems go.”
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: A misconfigured load balancer rule turned one server into a traffic magnet. This server waved a white flag and crashed, causing our web service to take a nap.
Resolution: We tweaked the load balancer rule, ensuring it spread traffic love equally among all servers. Balance restored, harmony achieved.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements Needed:

Double-check critical configurations. No more rogue rules.
Better monitoring and alerts for traffic distribution.
Sharpen our incident response with ninja-like precision.
To-Do List:

Patch Load Balancer Configurations: Hunt down and fix misconfigurations.
Monitor Traffic Distribution: Set up alerts for uneven server traffic. No more surprises.
Incident Response Training: Train engineers to be load balancer whisperers.
Regular Config Audits: Schedule audits to keep our systems in tip-top shape.
Traffic Surge Plan: Develop a plan to handle traffic spikes like a pro.
